    "    This notebook is an introduction to power system operations and the Pypownet usage. The operation of electrical power grids have been studied for many years around the world and involves many activities. Power grids, especially transmission grid, aims to transporting electricity over long distances from power plants to consumers. To be efficient and minimize energy losses, power grids often operate under high voltages (above 100kV). One of the main goals for power grid operators is to ensure a reliable and secure continuity of delivery of electricity to consumers under some additional quality criterion that can vary from one country to another.  \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    For simplicity, a four substations grid is presented here with producers and consumers meshed through a grid. However, transmission grids are more complex and involve many long lines that connect different cities or states. A grid often connects an entire country linking hundreds of power plants and distribution networks but our current example should illustrate clearly enough how congestion could arise on the power grid and which operation could help manage it. Congestion management is actually the most critical and time-consuming task for a power grid operator.\n",

    "    A power line has some physical capacity, aka thermal limit. Hence there is maximum power flow that is allowed through a line. Beyond it, a power line can break or can induce high risk for the safety of neighboring goods and people. We then say that a power line is congested, as illustrated by the power flow highlighted in yellow above. In that case, operators usually have only a few minutes to reduce the flows in lines. It is very usual for electrical operators to set up the thermal limits above 80% of the line capacity as a warning signal to avoid undesired damages in the equipment.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    The first thing operators need to know are the power flows through the lines of the grid to anticipate and monitor congestions. Power flows can actually be computed through physical simulators, under what is called a load flow computation, given productions, consumptions and the topology (aka the graph) of the grid.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    As a first intuition, power flows increase when electrical consumption increases. More specifically, the flows in lines are affected by the dynamics of much electrical consumption and the availability of power plants or productions. It often varies along the course of a day, as consumer behaviors and usages change depending on the hour of the day: there are more activities in the middle of the day, while lighting is used mostly overnight and people finally get to sleep, leaving mostly electrical heating systems as well as some few industries in operations.   \n",
    "<br><br>  \n",
    "    The congestion could be caused by day to day demand, but can also be due to some external factors such as topology grid changes by operator's actions, lines in maintenance or transient faults that can lead to cascading failures or put the system in an instability condition.\n",

    "    In this notebook, we reviewed very quickly the main operation principles in transmission networks with a small grid. The continuity of the electric power service is crucial for nowadays economy and should be robust enough to any hazards or atypical sistuations in its operations. A undesired line disconnection without an effective action that could solve the problem might bring blackouts and economic losses. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    As we mentioned earlier, transmission operation involves many tasks but all of them are met to have one single objective: supply reliable and secure electricity. Operators work every day to minimize the impact of external factors that put the electrical system at risk but eventually when the grid is large and meshed, the daily operation is more complicated.\n",

    "    The Pypownet platform was designed to interact together with the reinforcement learning approach. It allows executing actions in the transmission grid to manage lines with congestion without any cost involved. We covered all actions such as line disconnection and node splitting in the respective section. A user could play and execute more complicated ones through combinations.  \n",
